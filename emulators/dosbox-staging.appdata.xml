    <p>
      DOSBox is a DOS-emulator using SDL for easy portability to different platforms.
      DOSBox has already been ported to several different platforms, such as
      Windows, BeOS, Linux, Mac OS X...
    </p>
    <p>
      DOSBox emulates a 286/386 realmode CPU, Directory FileSystem/XMS/EMS, a SoundBlaster card
      for excellent sound compatibility with older games... You can "re-live" the good old days
      with the help of DOSBox, it can run plenty of the old classics that don't run on your
      new computer!
    </p>
    <p>
      This version of DOSBox is sandboxed. You have to copy your DOS files to your Documents
      directory and mount them using a mount command in DOSBox.
